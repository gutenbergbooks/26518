<div class='right'><h2><span class="u">Explanatory Note</span></h2></div>


<p><i>The book containing this journal is an ordinary pocket
memorandum or account book measuring 6 x 4&frac14; inches and
covered with split calf. The journal opens the day of the
author's capture, and closes on the day he receives orders at
Quebec to prepare to leave for Boston. The author's name is
nowhere to be found in the book, and several pages at the
beginning have been cut out, evidently by the original owner.
The journal was found among the papers of the late J. Gradden,
a benevolent merchant of Quebec who rendered considerable aid
to the American prisoners of war confined there on prison
ships. The journal was no doubt presented to Mr. Gradden
by its author as a return for kindnesses. Mr. Gradden's son,
the late Chas. Gradden of Kilmarnock, gave it to Sir James
M. LeMoine, the venerable Historian of Quebec, who in turn
presented it to me with the understanding that I would edit
and print it.</i></p>

<p><i>Although the author's name is not attached to the journal
it bears unmistakable evidence of having been written by Surgeon's
Mate James Reynolds who was deputed by Surgeon
General Edwards of Gen. Hull's army to the charge of the
sick on the two vessels that were dispatched from Maumee to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Detroit, but which were captured at Fort Malden (Amherstburg)
by the British. Lossing, in his "Pictorial Field Book of
the war of 1812" says that the schooner conveying the sick in
charge of Reynolds escaped and reached Detroit, and that the
Dr. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Reynold's'">Reynolds</ins> of this expedition was killed at the attack on
Detroit by a cannon ball. There is a mistake somewhere as
the author of this journal says that</i> <span class="smcap">he</span> <i>was in charge of the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Cugahoga'">Cuyahoga</ins> conveying the sick, and that the accompanying
schooner carried the stores, and that both vessels were captured
at Malden. Could it be that there were two Reynolds, one the
Surgeon's Mate and the other the Dr. Reynolds that Lossing
refers to as having been killed, and hence the confusion?
I am inclined to this view in the absence of convincing proof
to the contrary. The journal itself is strongly corroborative
of my contention as the weight of evidence is with the writer
whose story is everywhere the simple straightforward one of
the daily chronicler of the events that came under his observation.
It is a very human document and not without historical
value. It will take its place in the Archives of the war of
1812 on the Frontiers.</i></p>

<div class='right'><h2><span class="u">Historical Note</span></h2></div>


<p><i>Anticipating the formal declaration of war President
Madison of the United States during the winter of 1811-12
commissioned Gov. Wm. Hull of the Territory of Michigan
as a Brigadier General to command the Ohio and Michigan
troops at Detroit, with the understanding that immediately
upon the announcement of war he was to invade all that part
of Canada contiguous to Detroit. On June 24th, 1812, Gen.
Hull with several thousand troops had arrived at Fort Findlay.
Here he received despatches from Washington to hasten his
forces to Detroit and there await further orders. When the
troops arrived at the navigable waters on the Maumee (or Miami)
Hull determined to relieve his tired men of as much
baggage as possible by dispatching it by water. Accordingly
a considerable portion of the stores and intrenching tools,
Hull's and his staff's personal baggage, and the trunk containing
Hull's instructions and the muster rolls of the army together
with other valuable papers&mdash;also three officers' wives, Lt.
Goodwin, Lieut. Dent with thirty soldiers were transferred to
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Cugahoga'">Cuyahoga</ins> packet and an auxiliary schooner. Both reached
Maumee Bay where Toledo now stands on the evening of
July 1st. On the morning of the 2nd of July the Cuyahoga<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and the schooner entered the Detroit River and while sailing
past Fort Malden (Amherstburg) the British armed vessel
Hunter went alongside of the Cuyahoga, and vessel and cargo
became a prize, while the crew, troops and passengers were
declared prisoners of war. Lossing says that the auxiliary
schooner bearing the invalids, being behind the Cuyahoga,
escaped and reached Detroit next day. The author of the
journal says that this auxiliary vessel which contained only
the stores was also captured later in the day and brought in
under the guns of Fort Malden. Col. St. George, the commander
at Fort Malden, had received the news of the declaration
of war on the 30th of June, while Gen. Hull only received it
on the 2nd of July when he immediately despatched an officer
to the mouth of the Raisen to intercept the two vessels, but he
arrived too late. In the capture of these two vessels valuable
stores and yet more valuable information fell into the hands
of the British. The journal of the Surgeon's Mate begins
July 1st and some of the events that lead to the final surrender
of Detroit and the forces under Gen. Hull's command are
recorded in the journal from such observations as were possible
to a prisoner on a vessel, and from stray information. The
journey from Malden to Quebec is recounted and the subsequent
imprisonment there on a ship in the harbor until he with
others were sent to Boston for exchange.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class='right'><h3>at Fort Malden and Quebec<br />
<span class="u">in the War of 1812</span></h3></div>


<p>July 1st (1812).&mdash;After a long and tedious march I
with the sick, went on board the Caryaorgo<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> packet at
Maume, a little town on the Maume River<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Doctor
Edwards Surgeon General of the North Wertern Army gave
me charge of the Hospital stores and sick to go by water
to Detroit. We sailed about 4 p.m. and had a gentle
breeze the afternoon. At sunset the wind died away and
we ancored for the night<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and about 4 o'clock in the morning
the wind rose and we weighed ancor and with a fair wind
entered Lake Erie all in to good spirits to think we should
be at Detroit by 3 o'clock in the afternoon. To our surprise
just as we were about to enter Detroit River we saw
a boat that hailed us and ordered the Captain to lower
his sails<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Our arms were all in the hole (hold) and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
men sick. I thought it improper to make any resistance
as I had not been informed that war was declared<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and had
not had orders from the Genl. to make any resistence.
Lt. Goodwin and 2nd Master Beatt and Mr. Dent paymaster
to the 3rd Regt. Ohio Vlts. and three ladies and
two soldiers wifes making in the whole forty-five in number
and not more than six well persons among them it must
have been imprudent in the highest degree to have attempted
to resisted a boat of eight well armed men and a Capt., and
another of 5 men who demanded us as prisoners of war
and we were nearly under the cover of the guns at Ft.
Malden, soever we gave ourselves up and was taken into
Malden and our property was all stored in the hole (hold)
and hatches nailed immediately and we were taken alongside
a prison ship. The next morning about X o'clock our
Schooner was<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> taken and all our effects even to a blanket.
The Doctor came on board to see some of the sick and I
asked him for knapsacks and blankets for the men which
were returned immediately and the cloths of the officers
and men on board.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;The day past with Mallone holey (wholly) the
men sick and despond, nothing pleasing appeard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>4th.&mdash;We were surrounded with Savages singing and
dancing their war dances through the town<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. O heavens
what a glory Sun for independence can any person discribe
the feeling of a free born subject to see the Savages dancing
their war dance and hooting about the town and to be
confined when we knew they were preparing (to) murder
our fellow creatures and not only the soldiers but the
helpless women and children. These horrible and dispicable
seens closed the day and Sol returned to his rest.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;Some gentlemen<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> from our (side) came from
Detroit with a flag of truce and brought news that our army
had arrived their safe and that the men were in tolerable
health and spirits but we could not see them without a
British being present. We sent some papers to Detroit
after having them examined (by) an officer (of) the Part
we would expect for prisoners<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>6th.&mdash;We were provided with tolerable rations, and
nothing happened through the day.</p>

<p>7th.&mdash;Nothing especial happened through the day, but
all the (men) were making preparations for war.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>9th.&mdash;Know news for prisoners.</p>

<p>X.&mdash;Nothing extra happened in the course of the day.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;We were moved below town. Dr. Davis attends
on our sick daily. The weather verry warm and the men
suffer much from the heat.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;We had a very warm day in the afternoon.
The officers and Indians were verry busy, however we
heard nothing<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>12th.&mdash;Sunday. The American troops crossed the
river into Sandwich and divested the people of their arms
and sent them to their farms.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;Monday. Pleasant and cool. Nothing extra
happened.</p>

<p>14th.&mdash;Tuesday. Nothing worthy of notice.</p>

<p>15th.&mdash;Wensday, healthy weather. People was moving
very much in town and considerable blustor.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>16th.&mdash;Thursday. Pleasant and cool. Capt. Brown<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
came to town with a flag of truce on and (what) express
news we knew not, but could judge by the movements.
Two topsail vessels were sent out of the river and the people
were moving out of the town at night.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;Friday. The Indians<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> were flocking into town
all the morning armed and painted black. A lousifer with
their arms and the town was in an uproar. It appeared by
ten o'clock that almost every person had left the town.
About five o'clock the Savages began to return into town
hollowing and barekin and firing all around our vessell,
and to crown the whole they had one of our men's scalp
stretched on a pole as they past by us to aggrevate us in
a helpless state and wound the feelings of prisoners. These
Indians<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> were headed by a british subject. Is it possible
that their can be so much corruption in the British Government.
They are void of feelings and in fact are as bad as
the savages themselves for they carry on their intrigues
under the pretence that they cannot govern the Indians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and in fact they themselves are personally at their head
and give them their instructions. God deliver me from
monarch's gag laws and all their subjects<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for free I was
born and free I'll die or by the sword shall we live like bruts
and worse, glory in each other's fall and more than that
confine our fellow creatures and tantalize them by the
blood of our fellow mortals. What will man do when left
to himself. But thanks be to God this (is) about the last
act of bravery you can show you are on your last legs.
The crown will loose another jewil and savage yell dispersed
and harmony fill the land. The eagle here shall build her
nest and every subject shall be at peice<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>18th.&mdash;Pleasant. All things peceable through (the)
day. About X o'clock in the evening their was an alarm<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and the prisoners, sick and well, were all ordered in to the
hole (hold) together and what a disagreeable (night) it was
to have forty men half sick all stowed together and some
had to stand all night.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>19th.&mdash;Sunday. Warm and muggy weather. Their
was considerable movement, the Indians again past armed
and about 2 p.m. we heard firing towards Sandwich<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. The
Savages returned about dark in not so good spirits as usual
and this led us to suppose their success had not been so
good as they could wish. About 8 in the evening their
came a party (of) Savages by and fired several times near
us and struck up their war hoop.</p>

<p>20th.&mdash;Monday. To day the Indians past by armed
as usual, they returned about sunset some verry much
fatigued. We were informed that the Indians and some
of the militia had a Scirmish with some of our troops
yesterday.</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;Tuesday. Cloudy and rain. Nothing extra
occurred.</p>

<p>22nd.&mdash;Wednesday. Everything still. Nothing extra

<p>24th.&mdash;Friday<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. Cold and pleasant for the season.
I was ordered to the King's Stores in order to give information
about the hospital stores. Everything peciable.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;Saterday. Pleasant. Nothing worth mentioning
through the day. The Indians went out as usual and
returned in the evening and are now partickular morn (ful).</p>

<p>26th.&mdash;Sunday. Nothing extraordinary.</p>

<p>27th.&mdash;Monday. We had three prisoners brought on
board our vessel one of which was from our army. We

crossed to Brown's town twelves boats loaded. I should
judge about 400 in numbers. I cannot tell their business.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;Tuesday. Pleasant. The troops and Indians
crossed the river as yestirday and returned about eight
o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;Wensday<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. Plesent. The Indians crossed the
river about 11 o'clock and the people appeared very much
allarmed. A party of them returned about sunset but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
boats had few in them. Their was six guns fired about
11 o'clock at Browns Town.</p>

<p>6th.&mdash;Thursday. Pleasant. Nothing in particular.</p>

from Fort Erie with about fifty or sixty<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. Nothing further

<p>No news from the army.</p>

<p>9th.&mdash;Sunday<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. The little brig. Hunter ret'd this
morning from Fort Erie. The people seemed to be in
considerable motion about tewlve o'clock and we heard
about sunset that their was an engagement on the other
side of the river. Considerable motion in the evening.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;Monday. Rainy in the morning. We herd in
the morning that they had a hard battle at Browns Town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and the Americans mentained their ground. Several killed
and wounded on both sides. We were likewise informed
that they intended to have another battle this day<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;Continued showers of rain. About 5 o'clock we
herd a continual firing near Browns Town which continued
about one hour and a half and from the nois the American
army drove the Indians and British<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. The Schooner
Chipoway came from Lk. Erie with one company of red
coats.</p>

<p>12th.&mdash;Monday. No rain. A little cloudy. The British
moved their army&mdash;moved from B (Browns) Town and it
appeared that the Indians had all come to this town and
left Browns Town.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;Thursday<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. Pleasant. The people had all left
the town. Not much moving until evening. The Indians
began their war dance and commenced firing about daily
daun and a bot (boat) entered the river about fifty in number
and the D. dis't. C. A. ball that evening herd both by the
Indians and white people.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p><p>14th.&mdash;Friday<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Pleasant. After (noon) made the
detail for the 13th. Their was five boats came up loaded
with soldiers, and five more this morning loaded with from
12 to 20 men in each making in the whole about 170 men.
Another boat arrived about eleven o'clock&mdash;20 men in it,
and the new soldiers all appeared to leave the town about
sunset.</p>

<p>15th.&mdash;Saterday. Foggy. The drums beat to arms
about sunrise and the troops were all in motion or at least
all that were left. The citizens all entered boats for Detroit,
as I am told. The Indians went by in boats. By land
about 300. About sunset the Cannon began to roar at
Sandwich<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>16th.&mdash;Sunday. Pleasant weather but unpleasant news
we herd about noon that Hull had given up Detroit and the
whole Territory Mitchigan. The Indians began to return
about sunset well mounted and some with horses and chais.
Who can express the feelings of a person who knows that
Hull had men enough to have this place three times and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
gave up his post. Shame to him, shame to his country,
shame to the world. When Hull first came to Detroit the
4th U. S. Regt. would have taken Malden and he with his
great generalship has lost about 200 men and his Territory<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>Can he be forgiven when he had command of an army
of about 2500 men besides the Regulars and Militia of his
Territory and given up to about 400 regular troops and
Militia and about 700 Indians.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;Monday. Clouday. The news of yesterday

Troops<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> were prisoners of war and the militia had liberty
to go home. We were taken from the Schooner Thames
and put into a little Schooner but every attention paid us
that was possible. In the evening we were ordered on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
